			This parameter can be used as an alternative to <paramref>command</paramref> and <paramref>command_script_file</paramref>.
			It contains scriptcode which will be transferred to the remote host as a file and will then be executed there.
			The script can access job and order parameters by environment variables.
			The names are in upper case and have "SCHEDULER_PARAM_" as a prefix.
			Order parameters with the same name overwrite task parameters.
