            Some remarks on regular expressions used in JobScheduler and YADE.
        </p>
        <p>
            A regular expression is not a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character#Files_and_directories">wildcard</a>.
            To get an idea of the differences users can check the meaning of the wildcard *.txt, which will
            select all file names with the file name extension ".txt".
            A regular expression works in a similar way, the "wildcard" just looks like "^.*\.txt$".
            This looks a little bit strange but it is more flexible and powerfull for filtering file names
            than the concept of wildcards, if users want to filter more complex names or patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The general syntax of a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>, also referred to as regex or regexp,
            is described
            <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html">
            here</a>.
            It is different to other regular expression implementations, for example in Perl.
        </p>
        <p>
            For further information about regular expressions see
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            If users want only parts of a regular expresion to be case sensitive, then they have the option to use
            the (?-i) and [optionally] (?i) modifiers: (?-i)G[a-b](?i).*
        </p>
        <p>
            Users dealing with Unicode characters should check if their regular expression engine properly supports Unicode.
        </p>
