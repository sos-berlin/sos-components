		Some remarks on regular expression, used in JobScheduler and YADE.
		</p>
		<p>
			A regular expression is not a
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_character#Files_and_directories">wildcard</a>.
			To get an impression of the differences one have a look on the meaning of the wildcard *.txt, which will
			select all filenames with the filename-extension ".txt".
			A regular expression to match, e.g. works the same way, this "wildcard" must look like "^.*\.txt$".
			That looks a little bit strange but it is much more flexible and powerfull on filtering filenames
			than the concept of wildcards, if one want to filter more complex names or pattern.
		</p>
		<p>
	        The general syntax of an
	        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>, also referred to as regex or regexp,
	        is described
	        <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html">
	        here</a>.
	        It is different to other RegExp definitions, e.g. as for Perl.
		</p>
	    <p>
	    	For further information on regular expressions see
	        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">java.util.regex.Pattern</a>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	As an extension of regular expression the [date:] variable is supported. Using this feature it is possible to create a regexp, which is
	    	depending on the date with is defined in the date-format.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	If you want (only part of the regex) to be case sensitive , then you have the option to use
	    	the (?-i) and [optionally] (?i) mode modifiers:    (?-i)G[a-b](?i).*
		</p>
		<p>
			If you're dealing with Unicode characters besides ASCII, check whether or not your regex engine properly supports them.
