			<p>
				This argument specifies the behavior for hosts that have not previously been involved in an SSH connection to the specific target host.
				By default it is not required that the client's "known_hosts" file includes the host key - this situation corresponds to use of the value "false".
				If this argument is set to "true" then the host key is expected in the user's "known_hosts" file and the connection will be refused 
				if the host key cannot be found. This setting forces to manually add new hosts to the "known_hosts" file.
