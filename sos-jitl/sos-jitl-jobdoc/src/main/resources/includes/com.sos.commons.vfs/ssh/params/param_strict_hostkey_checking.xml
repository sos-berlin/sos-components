			<p>
				This parameter specifies the behavior for hosts that have not previously been involved in a ssh connection to the specific target host.
				By default it is not necessary that the user "known hosts" files contain the host key which corresponds to the value "false".
				If this parameter is set to "true", the host key is expected in the user "known hosts" files and the connection will be refused 
				if the host key cannot be found. This setting forces the user to manually add new hosts to the "known hosts" files.
