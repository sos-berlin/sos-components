		<p>
			This argument specifies the authentication method to use for the connection to the SSH server:
			both the <paramval>publickey</paramval> and <paramval>password</paramval> methods are supported.
			The "Keyboard-Interactive" method is not supported as it makes not sense for an unattended application
            such as JS7 JobScheduler that does not dispose of a keyboard to type passwords on-the-fly.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the <paramval>publickey</paramval> authentication method is used
			then the path to the private key file has to be specified with the <paramref>auth_file</paramref> argument.
			Should the private key file be secured by a password then the password has to be specified with the
			<paramref>password</paramref> argument.
		</p>
		<p>
			The SSH server configuration decides about applicable authentication methods.
			Depending on the SSH server configuration use of the <paramval>password</paramval> authentication method is applicable or not.
			The SSH server configuration on Unix based servers typically is specified from the /etc/ssh_config configuration file.
