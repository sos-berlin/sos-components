			<p>
				Specifies the order in which an SSH client should try authentication methods.
				This allows the SSH client to prefer one method (e.g. publickey) over another method (e.g. password).
                In addition, it allows to specify a number of alternative authentication methods that can be used by a client,
                for example, if password and publickey authentication methods are specified then one of them is sufficient.
                This applies even in case of failure when using an authentication method as long as one of the
                remaining authentication methods succeeds.
