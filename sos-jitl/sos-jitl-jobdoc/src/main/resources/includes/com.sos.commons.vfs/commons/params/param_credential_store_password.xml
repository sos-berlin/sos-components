	<note>
		<p>
			The argument specifies the password to access a KeePass credential store.
            Use of this argument is discouraged as it makes no sense to hide passwords, for example
            to access a database, by openly specifying the password to the credential store with job arguments.
            Instead, it is recommended to use the <paramref>credential_store_key_file</paramref> argument
            to specify a file that is owned by the JS7 Agent and that is accesible to the Agent only to access a credential store.
