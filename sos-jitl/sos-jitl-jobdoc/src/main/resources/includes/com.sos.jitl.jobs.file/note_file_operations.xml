		The JITL category "FileOperations" includes commonly used operations such as copying, renaming, moving and deleting of files. 
		These File Operations are based on Java so they are available on all by JS7 Agent supported os-platforms. 
		In comparison with functions such as system-specific operating-system commands like copy, cp, move, mv, del and rm, 
		which behave differently on different operating systems, handling and behavior of the File Operations job-classes is 
		identical on all supported operating systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of the job implementations are supporting "regular expressions" on file names for filtering and searching the files which has to be processed.
	</p>
	<p>File operations are often used in workflows that e.g. receive files by SFTP, rename the files and transfer them to different locations.</p>
