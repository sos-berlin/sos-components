        The JITL category of "File Operations" includes commonly used operations such as copying, renaming, moving and deleting files. 
        File Operations are based on Java so they are available on all platforms supported by JS7 Agents. 
        In comparison with functions such as specific operating system commands such as copy, cp, move, mv, del and rm, 
        which behave differently on different operating systems, the handling and behavior of the File Operation template jobs is 
        identical on all supported platforms.

    <p>
        Most of the job implementations support "regular expressions" on file names for filtering and searching the files that should be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
        File operations are frequently used in workflows that for example receive files by SFTP, rename the files and transfer them to different locations.
