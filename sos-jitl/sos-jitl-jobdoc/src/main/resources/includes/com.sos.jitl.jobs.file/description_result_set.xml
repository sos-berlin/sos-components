        <title>Creating a Result Set</title>
        <p>
            This job will create a result set that is made available from a return variable.
            A result set contains the names of all files which are selected as specified by the filter or search criteria.
            The content of the result set is returned as a variable, but can be written to a file too.
        </p>
